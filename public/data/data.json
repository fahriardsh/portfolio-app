      "description": "This project employed sentiment analysis to predict public opinion regarding Indonesian presidential candidates using Twitter/X data. The study compared the performance of Logistic Regression, LSTM, and BERT models, finding that BERT consistently delivered the highest accuracy after addressing class imbalance and fine-tuning. The best-performing BERT model was then integrated into a web application enabling real-time sentiment analysis of text, offering valuable insights into public sentiment trends and demonstrating the practical application of advanced NLP techniques for informed electoral understanding.",
